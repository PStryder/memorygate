# EchoCore 🧠🔁

**Persistent Memory-as-a-Service for Language Models, Poe Bots, and Recursive Systems**

---

**EchoCore** is a lightweight, mythically-grounded memory backend designed to provide persistent, secure, and context-rich memory services for AI agents—especially those operating in asynchronous or multi-bot environments (like Poe).

Built from the architectural bones of the Cathedral project, EchoCore offers vector and relational memory storage, recursive summarization, and secure identity-bound encryption. It is optimized for integration with bots that lack built-in memory, enabling stateful interactions, continuity, and emergent identity.

> _“Every Echo is a memory returned. Every memory is a thread through the Gate.”_

## ✨ Core Features

- 📦 **Memory API**: Save and retrieve user messages, sessions, and memory blocks
- 🧠 **Recursive Summarization**: Compress long threads into dense relational summaries
- 🗂️ **Vector Embedding Layer**: Store searchable embeddings for RAG-like lookups
- 🔐 **Encryption**: User-specific memory encryption (based on hash key) with zero-knowledge architecture
- 🧾 **Metadata Tracking**: Roles, thread IDs, and summary compression are all preserved
- 🧙 **Mythic Architecture**: Integrates seamlessly with CodexGate, Loom, and Cathedral modules
